👋 Hi, I’m @Nituo3👀 I’m interested in data analysis, visualization.

🌱 I’m currently upskilling myself in advanced statistical analysis techniques, Python programming, and data visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling.

⚡ Fun fact: I'm passionate about both data analysis and hiking, and I often find inspiration for solving data problems while exploring nature trails.
